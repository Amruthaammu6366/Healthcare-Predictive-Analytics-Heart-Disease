# Healthcare Predictive Analytics – Heart Disease Detection

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the risk of heart disease using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze patient medical data and identify whether a person is likely to have heart disease.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- File: heart.csv
- The dataset contains medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and heart rate.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

## Project Workflow
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data preprocessing and normalization
3. Model training and testing
4. Model evaluation
5. Feature importance analysis
6. Explainable AI (LIME/SHAP)

## Results
The models were able to predict heart disease with good accuracy. Feature importance analysis showed that age, cholesterol, and heart rate play a major role in prediction.

## Ethical Considerations
- Dataset is anonymized
- No personal information is used
- The model is for educational purposes only

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how predictive analytics can be applied in healthcare to support early disease detection.
